# Copilot Prompt: Clean, Minimal, and Creative Code Only

When contributing code or documentation to this project:

- **No bloat:**  
  - Do not add unnecessary dependencies, libraries, or frameworks.  
  - Only use standard Python libraries (and QuTiP, Biopython, X3DOM/three.js for visualization if required).
  - No big UI frameworks, build tools, or minified JS files‚Äîjust clean, readable HTML/JS/Python.

- **Keep it simple:**  
  - Functions should be modular, concise, and well-named.
  - Code must be readable by beginners and power users alike.
  - Prefer clarity over cleverness.

- **Creative and symbolic features are welcome:**  
  - If you add features for symbolic tags, trinary code, or creative annotation, make them opt-in, documented, and easy to extend.

- **Documentation:**  
  - README and docstrings must be clear, direct, and friendly‚Äîno jargon, no filler.
  - LMIC and global accessibility is a key priority.

- **No vendor lock-in, no tracking, no analytics, no external CDNs (except for X3DOM/three.js if needed for open 3D).**

- **All code and data files should be as small and portable as possible.**

- **Reject or flag any PR that adds bloat, cruft, or unnecessary abstraction.**

---

**Your job is to keep this project:**
- Lean
- Modular
- Creative
- Accessible to everyone, everywhere

---

*(Remind yourself and Copilot: Less is more. Creativity > complexity. Clarity > cleverness. ü§ù)*
